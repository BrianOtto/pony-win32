# pony-win32

This is a Win32 wrapper for [Pony](https://www.ponylang.org/).

It's currently a work in progress, but it includes a helper package (winApp) and examples showing how to ...
* create basic windows and system controls
* handle window messages
* do event handling
* convert between Pony strings and wide character strings (WCHAR_T)
* draw to a window using Cario
